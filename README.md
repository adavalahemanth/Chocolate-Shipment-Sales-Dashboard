# Chocolate-Shipment-Sales-Dashboard
As part of my data analytics learning journey, I built an interactive dashboard using Power BI to analyze chocolate shipment data across global regions.

 What I Did:
✅ Analyzed key metrics like Total Sales ($141M), Total Boxes (9M), and Profit Percentage (57.3%)
✅ Identified top-performing products, salespeople, and underperforming SKUs
✅ Created slicers, KPIs, geo visuals, and custom DAX measures for deeper insights
✅ Designed clean, stakeholder-friendly visuals using Excel as the data source

📊 Tools Used:
Power BI | Excel | DAX | Data Modeling | Data Cleaning

🧠 Key Insights:
📦 25K+ Shipments analyzed
🌍 India and New Zealand lead in total sales
💡 70% Dark Bites had the highest profit margin (77.1%)

This project helped me strengthen my skills in dashboard storytelling, data modeling, and business insights. I'm now excited to take on real-world opportunities in the Data Analyst space!
